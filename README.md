# CMPS128_Assignment4

Assignment 4 for CMPS 128: Fault tolerant distributed key-value store with replication that provides causal consistency and uses consistent hashing to partition data across multiple shards.

Lots of cleaning up to be done here throughout most of the repo; however, generally works with the only exception being resharding. 

## :rocket: Quickstart

```bash
Run test script
sudo python3 test_assignment4_v4.py
```
