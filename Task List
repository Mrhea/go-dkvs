Task List:
  SHARDING =========================
    - Mechanism to determine placement of nodes within shards to ensure fault tolerance +++++++++++++
    - Get the shard IDs of the store (id of each shard)
    = Get the shard ID of a node (which shard a node belongs to)
    = Get the members that belong to a specific shard ID
    = Get the number of keys in a shard
    - Add a node to a shard
    - Mechanism to reshard the store when an administrator(client) sends a reshard request to a node ++++++++++
  VIEW ================================
    NOTHING
  KEY VALUE OPERATIONS ========================
    - all keys need to be evenly distributed across all shards/ a key-to-shard strategy +++++++++
    - any node should be able to determine which shard a key is in
    - PUT/DELETE/GET works for any key for any node keeping causal consistency
